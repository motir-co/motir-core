#
#   DEPLOY_STACKS="<stack> [<stack>...]" bash <this file>
#
# Two things nothing else coordinates:
#
#   1. motir-infra's deploys change the same ECS services. A roll that overlaps a
#      stack update loses to it, and the merge never reaches ECS. So wait for the
#      stacks that own these services to settle.
#   2. Deploys are serialised, not ordered, so an older commit can roll after a
#      newer one and put the older image back with every run green. So a first
#      attempt whose commit is no longer main's newest stands down: the newer
#      commit's deploy carries it. A re-run or a manual dispatch is deliberate and
#      still deploys, with a warning.
#
# It writes `deploy=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and always exits 0. A check that
# cannot answer (no permission, no network) warns and deploys, because it must
# never stop a deploy that would otherwise have gone out.
#
# It narrows the race and does not close it: a stack update that starts after the
# roll begins still collides. Closing that needs a lock shared across the repos.
